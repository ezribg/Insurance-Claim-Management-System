# SE361

Gorilla Claim (GC) was built as part of SE 361, Introduction to Software Engineering, with the help of Professor Panos Linos. We chose the insurance claim management system as our project this semester and were subsequently given the software requirements that we translated into user stories. Our team then employed the methodologies of Scrum to satisfy these user stories and finish the project in about 14 weeks, over the course of six Sprints. Gorilla Claim allows login as a client, claim manager, finance manager, and administrator. Clients are able to file claims, which are viewable to everyone and then approved by the claim and finance managers. The administrator is also able to change the privileges of certain users. Every type of user is able to edit their profile and also send and receive messages as part of the claim process. Object-oriented design (OOD) and the creation of a local database in Visual Studio was used to add all of this functionality, and we also created several UML diagrams, an Entity-Relationship diagram, and a series of detailed wireframes to help us complete our tasks.
